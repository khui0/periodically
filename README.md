A simple to-do list you can check periodically to stay on top of things

Organize the things you've been putting off doing and set due dates for yourself. Tasks are automatically sorted by due date and are saved locally using the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)

Now includes different themes!

This project is tested with BrowserStack.
